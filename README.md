# Survival
An open source Survival server

# About
Aside from this being a live server, this also serves as a base template for others to use in their (Survival) servers

- The server is meant to be run on the latest version of Paper
- All plugins used on the server are 100% free (and, a lot are open source)

# Contributing
- Anyone is able to contribute anything (plugins, configurations, etc) to the server
- Pull Requests can be voted on by using reactions, and will be merged, or closed whenever we feel like it
- Try and avoid bloated plugins, and plugins that use NMS

# License
*not sure which one fits what I want to do, but, basically*
- Whatever you commit, you have rights to do so
- Whatever you commit may be used on the server, and forks of this project (and, you might not be credited; I'll do my best to, though!)
- Whatever you commit may be used for commericial usage

# Other
- There is no live server, yet, as there's no content
- This is all for fun
